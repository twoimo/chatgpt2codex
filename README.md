# ChatGPT To Codex

**Give ChatGPT real local coding hands.**

ChatGPT To Codex is a local MCP and Actions runtime for macOS and Windows that lets ChatGPT
work inside the project folder you choose: read files, search code, apply
patches, run tests, launch E2E checks, and send back screenshot proof.

Your source stays on your machine. ChatGPT connects to the local app you run.
You choose the workspace, approve the token, and keep control of what gets
edited.

> Help us get this in front of more builders: star the repo if you want
> ChatGPT to stop talking about code and start safely doing the repo loop.

## Why It Exists

ChatGPT is great at reasoning, but web chat alone cannot reliably inspect your
local repo, run your local tests, or prove what the UI actually looked like.
ChatGPT To Codex fills that gap:

- local project selection instead of uploading a source tree
- guarded file reads and hash-checked patching
- allowlisted local commands for tests and checks
- macOS/Windows app, window, and browser screenshot capture for visual E2E proof
- temporary or fixed HTTPS connector URL for ChatGPT web
- OAuth-style owner-token approval so random clients cannot just attach
- multilingual menu bar app for non-English users

The mental model is simple:

```text
ChatGPT thinks. Your computer acts. You review the result.
```

## Current Release

| Platform | Status | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Public release | `chatgpt2codex-0.2.0.pkg` |
| Windows | Public release | `chatgpt2codex-0.2.0-windows-setup.exe` |
| Linux | Developer path only | Not published |

### Why PKG Instead Of DMG?

For this release, **PKG is the better fit**. A DMG is nicer for drag-and-drop
apps, but this app needs to install a menu bar runtime under Applications,
bundle Node/cloudflared helpers, and run a non-blocking post-install Doctor.
PKG gives beginners a clearer "install and open" path. A signed/notarized DMG
can still be added later for a more consumer-style download.

```

## What ChatGPT Can Do With It

Once connected, ChatGPT can operate like a practical coding agent over a trusted
project:

- list local projects and select the active one
- read repo rules before editing
- search code and read exact line slices
- create files and apply patches
- run project commands and tests
- start a dev server and wait for a URL
- open a browser URL or installed desktop app
- capture macOS/Windows E2E screenshots
- return inline screenshot previews through Actions
- save generated image assets into the repo
- summarize diffs, blockers, and verification evidence

The standout workflow is:

```text
Run the E2E test, open the app, capture screenshots, and show me proof.
```

For web apps, ChatGPT To Codex can capture browser regions. For desktop apps
such as Tauri apps, it can open the built app window and capture top/middle/bottom
views. The one-shot `e2e_test_and_show_screenshot` action returns inline
`imageMarkdown` results so you can inspect the screen without digging through
local folders.

## Install In 5 Minutes

Full beginner guide: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

macOS short version:

1. Download `chatgpt2codex-0.2.0.pkg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ezBuilder/chatgpt2codex/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
2. Open the installer.
3. If macOS blocks the unsigned package, Control-click it, choose **Open**, and
   confirm in **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security** if needed.
4. Open **ChatGPT To Codex** from Applications.
5. Open **Settings...** from the menu bar icon.
6. Choose a project folder.
7. Enable **ChatGPT web connector** if you want ChatGPT in the browser to connect.
8. Click **Start MCP**.
9. Click **Copy Connector URL**.
10. Register that `/mcp` URL in ChatGPT Apps / Connectors and approve with the
    Owner Token shown by the app.

Windows short version:

1. Download `chatgpt2codex-0.2.0-windows-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ezBuilder/chatgpt2codex/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
2. Double-click the installer.
3. If Windows SmartScreen warns, choose **More info** -> **Run anyway** only if
   the file came from this GitHub release.
4. Launch **ChatGPT To Codex**.
5. Open the tray icon settings, choose your project folder, enable the ChatGPT
   web connector if needed, then click **Start MCP**.
6. Copy the `/mcp` Connector URL and approve it in ChatGPT with the Owner Token.

Keep the Owner Token private. Treat it like a password.

### Custom GPT Actions

ChatGPT To Codex can also be attached to a Custom GPT through the Actions
bridge. Import the running server's `/actions/openapi.json` URL in the Custom
GPT editor, configure Bearer authentication with the Owner Token, and save the
GPT. Use the exact public origin reported by the running app or server; temporary
tunnel hostnames must be re-imported after they change.

On macOS, **Read-only ChatGPT MCP tools** is available only in the exact
monitor mode `CHATGPT2CODEX_ACTIONS_MODE=github-pr-monitor`. In that mode the
remote MCP server exposes the authenticated-account GitHub PR read operation
only; hidden write/control tools are not registered and cannot be called.
Authenticate GitHub locally first with `gh auth login`. The monitor reads open
PRs authored by, or directly requesting review from, the authenticated account
across visible repositories, with bounded discovery/snapshot output and
redacted review/check metadata. It does not comment, edit, commit, push, or run
monitor state, migration, or reconciliation operations.
A separately selected `CHATGPT2CODEX_ACTIONS_MODE=github-pr-monitor-write` surface exists for phase-2 bounded writes. It exposes only dedicated v5 preview, approval/request, status, review-effect, disposable-worktree commit, and compare-and-swap non-force push routes. It requires the fixed `Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code` / `twoimo` target, fresh GitHub evidence, `CHATGPT2CODEX_MONITOR_ROLLOUT=enabled`, and a same-UID macOS helper using a P-256 Secure Enclave key with `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` + user presence and DER/X9.62 signatures; owner/OAuth authentication, `confirm:true`, browser dialogs, noninteractive approval, and generic call-tool/GitHub mutation commands cannot authorize a write. The only administrative CLI vectors are `github-pr-write --enable`, `--revoke`, `--status`, and `quarantine-v4`; challenge IDs and approval IDs are rejected. Ambiguous remote outcomes remain pending for explicit recovery and are never retried automatically.
The macOS package requires a real Apple code-signing identity, an exact Xcode/macOS development provisioning profile for the nested `app.ezbuilder.chatgpt2codex.operator-helper` bundle, and team-scoped keychain entitlements for the Secure Enclave helper; ad-hoc signing or an unprovisioned helper is refused for write-capable packaging. Local development may use an Apple Development Personal Team identity with an Xcode-generated profile via `CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, `CODESIGN_TEAM_ID`, and `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_PATH`; the profile must authorize the helper bundle identifier and both the helper default and operator keychain groups. The helper is launched from `Contents/Helpers/ChatGPTToCodexOperatorHelper.app` so macOS can validate its restricted entitlements. The status-bar app also starts the host admin relay; keep it running before invoking `github-pr-write` so the public socket can create, verify, and commit the helper-signed envelope.
Authored source updates and pushes may target only the operator-owned `twoimo/gajae-code` fork; the upstream repository owner retains merge authority.
The monitor caps each discovery list at 1,000 issues, limits child feedback pages and
thread comments, and reports `complete: false` whenever a PR closes or a reviewer
request changes during the read. Repository keys are canonical lowercase
`owner/name` values. Unknown or deleted GitHub actors are represented explicitly
and are never treated as authenticated users.

Interactive Custom GPT conversations can invoke Actions. In current ChatGPT
scheduled tasks, the scheduled conversation may not inherit the Custom GPT's
Actions connection. Creating an hourly task is therefore not proof of local
execution; use **Run now** and require a visible tool result before relying on a
schedule. Keep a schedule paused when it reports that the Action is unavailable.

## First Prompt To Try

```text
Use ChatGPT To Codex. Select my project, read the README and package scripts,
run the safest available check, then summarize the result with exact evidence.
```

Then try a visual proof flow:

```text
Use ChatGPT To Codex to run the app E2E, capture screenshots, and show the
passing screenshot set inline before you say it is done.
```

## Safety Model

ChatGPT To Codex is designed for trusted local development, not arbitrary public
automation.

- It runs locally on your computer.
- It defaults to loopback-only networking.
- ChatGPT web requires an explicit connector/tunnel mode.
- File operations are scoped to the selected project.
- Patch application uses line/hash context.
- Owner Token approval is required for remote Actions access.
- Secret-looking values are redacted from tool output.
- Destructive, network, and sensitive operations remain approval-gated.

Do not expose the connector URL publicly unless you understand the tunnel and
token model. Do not paste Owner Tokens into issues, screenshots, or shared logs.

## Supported Languages

The desktop app can follow the system language and currently includes UI strings
for English, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Spanish,
French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Turkish,
Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Arabic, Hindi, and Ukrainian.

The install guide currently includes Korean, English, Japanese, and Simplified
Chinese. More documentation languages are welcome.

## Windows Status

Windows now has a public beginner installer. It includes the tray launcher,
owner-token setup flow, ChatGPT web connector settings, stale runtime cleanup,
and Windows E2E screenshot proof. See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) and
[windows/README.md](windows/README.md) for the full Windows guide.

## Repository Contents

This public repository is intended to contain only the product source, public
documentation, assets, scripts, and published installer artifacts. Local agent
state, personal automation rules, generated memory, hooks, private MCP config,
build output, and machine-local logs are ignored.

If you see local-only files in a clone, they came from your machine, not from
the public repo.

## Build From Source

For developers:

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Build the macOS package:

```bash
npm run macos:package
```

The packaging script creates a `.pkg` under `build/macos/`. Published packages
are copied to `installers/macos/`.

## Star Pitch

If this saves you one "copy this patch, paste it in terminal, now run tests,
now send me a screenshot" loop, give it a star. The goal is simple: make
ChatGPT useful for real local development without turning your project into a
cloud upload.
